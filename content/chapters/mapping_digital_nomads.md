Recently we have seen the emergence of remote workers, or digital nomads, who can work from anywhere around the globe as long as they have a good internet connection. What happens when labour is decoupled from a fixed office location, when employment no longer relies on being physically proximate to certain sites? I am reading this change within the framework of Saskia Sassen’s Global Cities, where global production has been reconfigured around producer services in a few key global nodes. With the continued development of communication and transportation technologies, the work performed by these type of firms is increasingly being able to be performed anywhere. If workers no longer “need” to work within these global nodes, will they continue to do so? How are their movements changing the ways that cities connect to one another? How are they changing networks of production and consumption? Is this happening along the same lines that the globalized production of firms is? How are these mobile workers creating new types of global flows that could alter and affect others?

To answer these questions, I utilized computational social science methodology, creating a social network graph of what cities are being connected through the movements of these Digital Nomads, and then mapped this network to pull out any unique spatial relations this population is creating. The social network graph was created by compiling data from nomadlist.com, a social networking site for digital nomads where users chart their travel between cities. The network model covers 737 total cities around the world. This model finds that the top 25 digital nomad cities overlap with lists of top Global Cities in some ways, but diverge in many others, namely with the emergence of Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and much of South East Asia as powerful players in the digital nomad network.
