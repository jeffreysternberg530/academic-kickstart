Labour (De)Territorialized: Digital Nomads, Gig-Living, and Accessing the City in the Age of the New Urban Crisis
</h2>

A whole population of young highly-mobile individuals are pursuing their futures amidst an increasingly global and uneven geographic distribution of jobs located in inaccessible cities, left to make their way in the world at the height of the new urban crisis.

Utilizing a mixed methods approach including multi-sited ethnography and methods from the computational social sciences, I unpack how this population interprets their position within the global urban landscape and how these interpretations guide where they invest their mobility. I explore how this mobility differentially impacts the places this population flows to and how it reconfigures relationships between cities and labour in broader urban networks.
