<h2>Abstract</h2>

A whole population of young highly-mobile individuals are pursuing their futures amidst an increasingly global and uneven geographic distribution of jobs located in inaccessible cities: the new urban crisis. Mobility is a key tool this population utilizes in response to this crisis, connecting to cities in new ways through trends such as co-living and remote work. Utilizing a mixed methods approach including multi-sited ethnography and methods from the computational social sciences, I unpack how this population interprets their position within the global urban landscape and how these interpretations guide where they invest their mobility. I explore how this mobility differentially impacts the places this population flows to and how it reconfigures relationships in broader urban networks.

<h2>Purpose and Significance</h2>

Jobs and opportunities are unevenly geographically distributed, hoarded within a few increasingly inaccessible cities. This inaccessibility is perpetuated by the very scarcity of the resources within and the processes set in motion by those attempting to access them. Achieving tenancy in these cities has become a make or break moment for many young people around the world who must be able to put together a key bundle of resources to achieve and maintain this tenancy: namely employment and residency wrangled through mobility. Attaining this basket of goods in these cities has become a herculean challenge for those already in the city and those outside it, the demand for access to the city driving up housing prices, while also tightening a shrinking labour market. The jobs that these people flock to the city for are also undergoing their own deskilling leading to lower wages, a lack of benefits, horizontal career paths, and temporary contracting jobs, producing employment that cannot meet the costs of living in the very cities they moved to for these opportunities. This has led to increased mobility between cities in pursuit of stabile tenancy. These concurrent processes end in crisis, challenging the very basis that makes the city attractive in the first place. It is only by understanding how the people living through this situation are interpreting and reacting to this situation though their mobility that we can begin to see how access to the city is still being achieved, but also the potential fixes that can lead to a way out of this crisis. This dissertation aims to uncover how this crisis is currently being navigated and to catalogue practical actions that could help alleviate the pressure these cities are currently facing. By also focusing on the emergence of remote work in this context, I aim to understand the growing alternatives to this state of affairs, the break between work and residence it promises, and the new types of urbanization opened up by it.

<h2>Revisiting the Urban Question in the Age of the New Urban Crisis: The (Re)Production of the Regime of Flexible Accumulation</h2>
<br/>
<p>
Scholars have recently remarked upon the emergence of what Richard Florida has termed The New Urban Crisis, a global phenomenon whereby cities are being lumped into winners and losers, with inequality rising in the winner cities where real estate prices are pushing out those who most need access to the opportunities hoarded within. The explanations for this state of affairs refer mostly to dynamics internal to cities, the city serving as the site and scale upon which this crisis arises. This focus on the city serves as an ideological obfuscation of the structural machinations that enunciate the new urban crisis, itself a symptom of greater crises occurring at the level of global capitalism.
</p>
<p>
By revisiting Castells’ The Urban Question, I reread the new urban crisis by considering how the urban social structure fits into the reproduction of capitalism on a global scale. I argue that the new urban crisis is generated by the urban social structure being asked to reproduce two distinct circuits of capital accumulation set loose by the transition to post-industrialism: accumulation via production and accumulation via finance. These distinct circuits of accumulation utilize the elements of urban social structures differentially, often at cross purposes. This complicates and produces continued crises in the reproduction of capitalism, as well as continually shifting relations between elements of the urban social structure, producing a plurality of socio-spatial forms. I end the paper by investigating the emerging reactions and solutions to these crises, including remote work and mobility to different socio-spatial formations, as grounds for both the continuation and potential transformation of the whole global capitalist system.

<h2>Pop-Up Urbanism (as a way of life)</h2>
<br/>
<p>
In this chapter, I investigate an emergent type of urbanism resulting from the new relationships urban nomads as a population are making to the city of Los Angeles and beyond. I argue that members of this forming urban nomad population employ particular spatial and cultural practices in order to adapt to macro-structural changes in the economy. Drawing upon an ethnographic study of Los Angeles’ PodShare co-living space, this chapter focuses on two of these spatial and cultural practices in particular: co-living and place resumes. Co-living here is understood as a spatial and cultural practice performed by members of the forming urban nomad class fragment to actualize and make possible the mobility demanded of them by the shifting economy, an activity carried out within particular spaces and sites.
</p>
<p>
I introduce the site of the co-living space which can best be characterized as a hybrid space of work, leisure, and domicile in the context of post-industrial economic restructuring and the emergence of young urban nomads. This site is uniquely suited to the wants and needs of urban nomads, acting as a space through which highly mobile and precarious individuals flow as they attempt to connect to the city and the life opportunities it offers. I introduce the term “place resumes” to describe the emergent cultural and identity work that is produced in hybrid live-work spaces.
</p>
The place resume is produced through the sharing of travel narratives within this field of co-living, representing this population-specific mobility both between and within cities. These representations then become emergent cultural products used by urban nomads to represent themselves to others, signify distinction within their population, set authentic ends for consumption and action, make meaning of their geographic flight, and anchor their identities. I argue that this leads to the constitution of a new type of urbanism or way of relating to the city, or in this case cities, that are plural and ephemeral, best represented by the motif of a Pop-Up restaurant or exhibition.

<h2>The New Global Urban Networks of Remote Work: Mapping the Trajectories of Digital Nomads and Charting the Construction of their Discursive Subjectivity</h2>
<br/>
<p>
Recently we have seen the emergence of remote workers, or digital nomads, who can work from anywhere around the globe as long as they have a good internet connection. What happens when labour is decoupled from a fixed office location, when employment no longer relies on being physically proximate to certain sites? I am reading this change within the framework of Saskia Sassen’s Global Cities, where global production has been reconfigured around producer services in a few key global nodes. With the continued development of communication and transportation technologies, the work performed by these type of firms is increasingly being able to be performed anywhere. If workers no longer “need” to work within these global nodes, will they continue to do so? How are their movements changing the ways that cities connect to one another? How are they changing networks of production and consumption? Is this happening along the same lines that the globalized production of firms is? How are these mobile workers creating new types of global flows that could alter and affect others?
</p>
<p>
To answer these questions, I utilized computational social science methodology, creating a social network graph of what cities are being connected through the movements of these Digital Nomads, and then mapped this network to pull out any unique spatial relations this population is creating. The social network graph was created by compiling data from nomadlist.com, a social networking site for digital nomads where users chart their travel between cities. The network model covers 737 total cities around the world. This model finds that the top 25 digital nomad cities overlap with lists of top Global Cities in some ways, but diverge in many others, namely with the emergence of Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and much of South East Asia as powerful players in the digital nomad network.
