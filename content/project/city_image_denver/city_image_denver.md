summary: "A Computational Social Science Project investigating the multiple bases and sources of a city's image. We investigate the theoretical sources of city image by conducting an empirical case study of the City of Denver, running a structural topic model on description and review text data from AirBnb, Yelp, and Google Places merged at the census tract level with demographic meta-data from the Census/ACS. By investigating different actors and sharing economy platforms, and the compilation of their representations on the level of the census tract, we aim to investigate where certain representations of place can be formed and where they can't, and by whom, using the Census/ACS demographic data to test the influence of social structure on these representations."

<h2> Project Overview </h2>
<p>
A Computational Social Science Project investigating the multiple bases and sources of a city's image. We investigate the theoretical sources of city image by conducting an empirical case study of the City of Denver, running a structural topic model on description and review text data from AirBnb, Yelp, and Google Places merged at the census tract level with demographic meta-data from the Census/ACS. By investigating different actors and sharing economy platforms, and the compilation of their representations on the level of the census tract, we aim to investigate where certain representations of place can be formed, where they can't and by whom using the Census/ACS demographic data to test the influence of social structure on these representations.

<h2>Research Goals and Questions</h2>
<p>
The goal of this project is to compile a gigantic web-based quantitative and qualitative data set for investigating the linkages and interactions between the sharing economy and emergent forms of urbanization. The data-set itself will serve as a rich resource for exploring multiple linkages and interactions both between platforms, as well as between platforms and locality. There are many directions we could take this exploration in, therefore we do not have one overarching research question, more a research theme: how do platforms and extra-local actors interact with localities, and how do the two co-determine one another.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Along these lines, we have generated a list of research questions we could explore with this dataset. The example research questions using Airbnb data set include: a) how much the success (e.g., rating, occupancy rate) of the place-based commodity of an airbnb listing relies on not only the housing characteristics but also the features of the neighborhood (e.g., crime, entertainment, gentrification); b) how the representations of a place (neighborhood) are leveraged differently by different actors in the same shared space (i.e., traditional business like restaurant, sharing economy actors like Airbnb listers, airbnb lodgers,etc), and c) the impact of the development of Airbnb on local economy and quality of life, building on the existing quantitative literature and building on it to include text-based analysis (e.g., review, listing data).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
This study hopes to open up new avenues for the study of city-image and representations of place, particularly the interactions between place-based commodities and their local neighborhoods, using computational methods to identify particular dynamics for further research. Moving forward, we can scale up the project by testing whether findings hold in comparable cities and whether results diverge by city characteristics. Additionally, this project will allow for testing policy effects (local regulation directly on the sharing economy and related sectors) with both qualitative and quantitative data.
</p>

<h2>Data and Analysis</h2>
<br/>
<p>
Data for this research are drawn from two major types of sources - privately collected data from internet platforms and publicly available data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We will use data from AirBnb, Yelp and Google Places, which are all datasets collected by internet platforms. This data will be combined with data from the American Community Survey, and the decennial census if necessary.

<br/>
<p>
By running a structural topic model on the text data collected from these multiple datasets (review of airbnbs, airbnb listings, yelp reviews, google reviews) alongside neighborhood characteristics and demographic data, the researchers will attempt to pull out themes relating to constructed city images that each type of place-based commodity relies on and utilizes in different ways, whose particular existence is dependent on the characteristics of the neighborhood it finds itself in. By looking for co-variation between different discursive topics and local characteristics, the researchers will investigate the aspects of place-based commodities that are invoked in different listings and reviews, attempting to parse out and understand how these topics are differentially invoked based on geographic area of the listing. Some dynamics we could study are whether city image is invoked more in areas proximate to downtown and central business districts while those farther out use different marketing topics to draw potential consumers, or whether it is differentially invokable depending on the amenities available and the demographics present in any given neighborhood.

<h2>Rationale for using Denver</h2>
<p>
The available Airbnb data are limited to 28 American Cities. We wanted to choose “ordinary” cities as opposed to “unique” cities that have already been overly investigated. We went through a round of thinking up similarities between cities and narrowed down to a few comparable cities, so that we can scale up our work for comparison in the future. We decided on Austin, Denver, and Portland due to their similarities (i.e. newer cities with recent population growth, music & tech-oriented labor force). We then decided on Denver, one of the prominent cities in the western part of the US, with a total area of 155m2 and a population of around 619,968 makes it an average sized US city. Denver’s population has increased by nearly 20% since 2010. We believe that such rapid population growth adds to the dynamism of a city and also makes a city ripe for a higher incidence of peer-to-peer economic exchange in the sharing economy.
