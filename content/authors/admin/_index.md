Jeffrey Sternberg is a PhD Candidate in the Sociology at Northeastern University. His research is primarily concerned with charting the shifting geographies of employment opened up by post-industrialization. He focuses on how young people make decisions regarding their future and where to invest their mobility. Jeffâ€™s dissertation research investigates these processes by looking at mobile populations including backpackers, temporary-workers, and digital nomads in the context of urban co-living spaces. He utilizes a mixed-methods approach, using techniques from the computational social sciences, including text analysis and social network analysis, coupled with multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in Los Angeles, CA and Dharamsala, India. His work as a research assistant investigates the potential application of computer vision to social science inquiries.
